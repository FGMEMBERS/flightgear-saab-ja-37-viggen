Startup
-----------
Start up engine and systems
Wait for the engine to spool up.
Apply full throttle with afterburner.
Release parking brakes.
    
Takeoff
------------
Mind the sidewind indicator in the HUD.
Takeoff at 315 km/h.

Landing
-------------
Land with speeds within 195-249km/h.
  and an Angle of Attack of 16.5 degrees.
Deploy reverse thrust after touchdown.

Flaps
---------
The JA-37 control the flaps automatically.
At takeoff and landing it will set flaps to 30 degrees down.
In flight it will be set at 4 degrees up.

Notes:
------
3D model and textures is made by Anders Lejczak <anders.lejczak@colacola.se>
FDM and mostly everything else by Necolatis: http://www.flightgear.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=13888
..except for code snippets and instruments and effects I used (most in modified form) from other aircrafts.

HUD info
--------
The HUD uses Km/h and meters.
When in landing/takeoff mode the sight will move to a side according to sidewind
When in navigation mode the sight will show the direction the plane is headed in, not where it is pointed
The digital altimeter to the left will use rader below 100 meters, a 'R' is shown when this happens, and regular altimeter above, up till 9999 meters.
If the radar-altimeter detects that the altimeter is not calibrated correct, it will blink QFE (happens only below 100 meters above terrain).
If QFE is displayed, but not blinking, the radar altimeter have calibrated the altimeter(will only happen when plane not moving)
The digital airspeed indicator at the bottom, will use Km/h until mach 0.5, after that it will show mach number
The artificial horizon and pitch lines are spaced 5 degrees.
To the right is a altimeter scale, below 100 meter the scale will become more detailed and below 50 even more. Above 1000 meters, one floating point decimal precision.
On the altimeter the symbol '77' indicates where radar altimeter detects the ground to be below plane centerline.
Next to '0' on the alt scale a '|' symbol will appear if the radar altimeter ground is higher than the altimeter 0.
The heading at the top is shown as a scale showing 1/10 of heading in degrees.


Known bugs:
-----------
The '77' symbol seems to be placed right of its place when running with fresh FG install. Wierd that can infuence nasal, needs more testing.


Liberties taken:
----------------
In the orig plane the HUD decimal delimiter is ','. I choose to use the english '.' instead.
The plane can calibrate the altimeter itself, only a placeholder for putting in the altimeter instrument, so the pilot can set it manually.
