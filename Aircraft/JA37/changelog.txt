1.8
---
Fixed small timing problem in HUD heading scale

1.9
---
HUD heading and alt scales ends now smothly comes into view 
Made altimeter calibrate only if plane not moving
Altimeter indicators are now drawn instead of characters
Altimeter scale is now slightly more compressed

1.10
----
Improved nasal HUD comments, and beautified the script
Changed 3D model to DATCOM generated one, due to possible license issue with other model, please stop using prior versions of this plane due to that.

1.11
----
Switched to Anders Lejczak's 3D model. (adapted it from Poser, relicensed to GPL 2)
Adjusted many things in model, and xml positions.
Adjusted materials for metal and glass.
Animated the rudder, elevons and flaps.
Made gears invisible when pulled up
Added strobe to model, and adjusted effect
Added navigation and beacon lights.
Made livery selection (Standard and Ground-Attack variant)
Removed the fly-by-wire system again
Adjusted AeroRP and CoG
Modified splash images
Removed smoke from wingtips
Adjusted exhaust smoke

1.12
----
Added cannon bullets and flares
Fixed Km/h airspeed was converted from knots opposite
Added normal map
Flipped normals on gear, some missile ends and canopy
Removed vertex colors on fuselage
Seperated closed gear doors and left gear
Animated gear doors and left gear
Fixed altitude numbers on high scale was floating point in 2.11
Added to fgdata GIT clone

1.13
----
Animation: Added proper animation of front and right gears
Animated front and right gear
Made fuselage less shiny to look more like military painted metal.
Adjusted stall warnings to alpha values from plane manual
Adjusted max sidewind indication to 30 kts, as per Draken, since I do not know Viggens.
Improved the stall warnings and made them louder.
Made chase views distance default.
Moved the HUD down and closer to pilot. Also fixed a xml bug.
Fixed '77' and 'QFE' symbols in HUD sometimes were displaced.
Updated wheel contact positions to new model.
Applied normal map and livery to new names of gear.
Work-around for shader bug
Upgraded the aircraft status
Changed the aerodynamic wing and canard profile. It can now takeoff at 300 Km/h.
Put in values for very high alpha to better simulate stalls.
Made stall warning audible in external view.
Changed lift and drag from DATCOM to graph data.
Fixed that droptank fuel was calculated into internal fuel tanks.
Switched afterburner to method 2.
Adjusted lift and drag from flaps, now almost match takeoff speed of 250Km/h as per the manual.
Fixed white on droptank
Set flaps position max to 30 degrees as per manual
Moved CoG 1 meter back as per document
Moved aerodynamic ref. point. further back than CoG as per document
Removed russian chronometer
Adjusted G-meter to new cockpit.
Made key 's' autostart and stop

HUD info
--------
The HUD uses Km/h and meters.
When in landing/takeoff mode the sight will move to a side according to sidewind
When in navigation mode the sight will show the direction the plane is headed in, not where it is pointed
The digital altimeter to the left will use rader below 100 meters, a 'R' is shown when this happens, and regular altimeter above, up till 9999 meters.
If the radar-altimeter detects that the altimeter is not calibrated correct, it will blink QFE (happens only below 100 meters above terrain).
If QFE is displayed, but not blinking, the radar altimeter have calibrated the altimeter(will only happen when plane not moving)
The digital airspeed indicator at the bottom, will use Km/h until mach 0.5, after that it will show mach number
The artificial horizon and pitch lines are spaced 5 degrees.
To the right is a altimeter scale, below 100 meter the scale will become more detailed and below 50 even more. Above 1000 meters, one floating point decimal precision.
On the altimeter the symbol '77' indicates where radar altimeter detects the ground to be below plane centerline.
Next to '0' on the alt scale a '|' symbol will appear if the radar altimeter ground is higher than the altimeter 0.
The heading at the top is shown as a scale showing 1/10 of heading in degrees.

Known bugs:
-----------
The '77' symbol seems to be placed right of its place when running with fresh FG install. Wierd that can infuence nasal, needs more testing.

Liberties taken:
----------------
In the orig plane the HUD decimal delimiter is ','. I choose to use the english '.' instead.
The plane can calibrate the altimeter itself, only a placeholder for putting in the altimeter instrument, so the pilot can set it manually.
