1.0
---
Got the idea to work on this plane.
JSBSim FDM and engine adapted from Aeromatic output
Flight controls mainly from F-16 (adjusted some values)
Engine fire, smoke and other effects adapted from F-16
Added thrust reverser
Converted 3D model from FS2004 (License: Creative Commons)
Added some annunciater sounds
Adapted some crash code from Mig-15

1.1
---
Fixed paths to work on Linux and Mac
Renamed folder to JA37 from ja37
Made all paths relative
Removed extra copies of model and textures

1.2
---
Put in a Accelerometer (small inaccuracy due to my limited painting skill)

1.3
---
Mapped fuel tanks to match the real aircraft
Put in a generic Canvas HUD
Put in a Chronometer from Buccaneer, to make it look less empty

1.4
---
Canvas HUD made brighter, and some details from orig plane added
Flight Dynamic Model now partly made by DATCOM. (drag & lift mainly)

1.5
---
Made texture a bit prettier
Made new splash image and thumbnail
Removed some debug messages

1.6
---
Made HUD pretty much function like the JA-37 (except for combat and landing)
Lowered pilot view 5cm to better align with the HUD

1.7
---
Added more info to the changelog.
Made HUD heading be a scale
Put in horizon line and pitch lines
Fixed some HUD bugs
Cleaned up the nasal HUD code a bit
Lifted pilot view 2cm
Switched HUD font, which fixed an alignment canvas bug
Made several adjustments to the HUD

1.8
---
Fixed small timing problem in HUD heading scale

1.9
---
HUD heading and alt scales ends now smothly comes into view 
Made altimeter calibrate only if plane not moving
Altimeter indicators are now drawn instead of characters
Altimeter scale is now slightly more compressed

Notes:
------
Beware, even though they are not animated the plane has reverse thrust, flaps and gear.


HUD info
--------
The HUD uses Km/h and meters.
When in landing/takeoff mode the sight will move to a side according to sidewind
When in navigation mode the sight will show the direction the plane is headed in, not where it is pointed
The digital altimeter to the left will use rader below 100 meters, a 'R' is shown when this happens, and regular altimeter above, up till 9999 meters.
If the radar-altimeter detects that the altimeter is not calibrated correct, it will blink QFE (happens only below 100 meters above terrain).
If QFE is displayed, but not blinking, the radar altimeter have calibrated the altimeter(will only happen when plane not moving)
The digital airspeed indicator at the bottom, will use Km/h until mach 0.5, after that it will show mach number
The artificial horizon and pitch lines are spaced 5 degrees.
To the right is a altimeter scale, below 100 meter the scale will become more detailed and below 50 even more. Above 1000 meters, one floating point decimal precision.
On the altimeter the symbol '77' indicates where radar altimeter detects the ground to be below plane centerline.
Next to '0' on the alt scale a '|' symbol will appear if the radar altimeter ground is higher than the altimeter 0.
The heading at the top is shown as a scale showing 1/10 of heading in degrees.


TODO:
-----
Contact author of another 3D model, to get well textured, animated plane
All fuel to engine has to go through tank 1
Fuel tanks 3V and 3H is used for flying upside down
Make pilot faint/die due to G-forces
Clean up the Aerodynmaic functions and the controls
Refine FDM (alot)
Put in more instruments
Better annunciater warnings and other sounds
Adapt for Rembrandt (future)
Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes
Make gears break if too high speed with gears down
Make canopy simulation
Adjust the engine fire and afterburner flame more precise.
Make lights work.
HUD: Make TILS landing system in the HUD
HUD: Make desired heading indicator in the HUD.
HUD: Make desired height columns and boxes
HUD: Different kind of pitch lines, depending on mode
HUD: make more methods out of similar code, introduce more comments and name variables better
HUD: alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: make symbol for warning: pull up!
