# depends: The output depends on the value of this property. Must be of type number or boolean.
# limit: A value or property that sets the lower limit. If depends is greater than limit then the state will be considered on.
# in: A property or value if the state is on. If in is set to '.' the depends value is copied to out regardless of state.
# out: The output property. Set to in if the state is on and off if not.
# off: A value or property that out is set to if the state is off.
# ramp: max change in out per second. Unlimited if 0.
