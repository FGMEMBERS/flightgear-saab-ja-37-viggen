==================================================================

Install
----------
1 - Have flightgear installed. Version 2.8.0.2 to 2.12.1 is tested. Earlier version will not work, later might.
2 - Copy the entire 'JA37' folder into a folder where Flightgear will look for aircraft.
3 - Happy flying. Check the aircraft help page inside the sim for instructions.


Suggested Settings

Wildfire: On (for crashing)
Particles: On (Used for various stuff)
Advanced weather: Generate aloft-waypoints, Generate thermals, Terrain Effects, Realistic visibility. (it's an all-weather fighter, it can handle it)

The aircraft is Rembrandt ready.
It models the mid 80'ties upgraded version of JA-37 (not to be confused with JA-37D)

Help?
-----
Looking for person to model 3D cockpit and/or instruments. Contact Necolatis on the forums to get started, got plenty of cockpit pictures.

Liberties taken:
----------------
In the orig plane the HUD decimal delimiter is ','. I choose to use the english '.' instead.
The plane can calibrate the altimeter itself, only a placeholder for putting in the altimeter instrument, so the pilot can set it manually.
