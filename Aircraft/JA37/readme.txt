==================================================================
Readme for the JA-37 Viggen aircraft for the Flightgear simulator:
==================================================================

Install
----------
1 - Have flightgear installed. Version 2.8.0.2 to 3.0.0 is tested. Earlier version will not work, later might.
2 - Copy the entire 'JA37' folder into a folder where Flightgear will look for aircraft.
3 - Happy flying. Check the aircraft help page inside the sim for instructions.


Suggested Settings
------------------
Wildfire: On (for crashing)
Particles: On (Used for various stuff)
Advanced weather: Generate aloft-waypoints, Generate thermals, Terrain Effects, Realistic visibility. (it's an all-weather fighter, it can handle it)
Rembrandt off, as it does not support the aircraft shaders used.
Atmospheric Light Scattering off, as it does not support the aircraft shaders used.

Notes
---------
The aircraft is sorta Rembrandt ready, no glaring issues.
It models the mid 80'ties upgraded version of JA-37 (not to be confused with JA-37D)

Looking for person to model 3D cockpit and/or instruments. Contact Necolatis on the forums to get started, got plenty of cockpit pictures.

Liberties taken:
----------------
In the orig plane the HUD decimal delimiter is ','. I choose to use the english '.' instead.
