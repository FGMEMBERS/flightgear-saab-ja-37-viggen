==================================================================
Readme for the JA-37 Viggen aircraft for the Flightgear simulator:
==================================================================

Install
----------
1 - Have flightgear installed. Version 2.8.0.2 to 3.0.0 is tested. Earlier version will not work, later might.
2 - Copy the entire 'JA37' folder into a folder where Flightgear will look for aircraft.
3 - Happy flying. Check the aircraft help page inside the sim for instructions.


Suggested Settings
------------------
Wildfire: On (for crashing)
Particles: On (Used for various stuff)
Advanced weather: Generate aloft-waypoints, Generate thermals, Terrain Effects, Realistic visibility. (it's an all-weather fighter, it can handle it)
Model-shader: top setting


Compatibility with Flightgear 2.8
---------------------------------
Delete the Material shaders section in JA37/Models/ja37-model.xml and it will fly fine.
Radar and HUD will be disabled automatically though when using FG 2.8


Notes
---------
The aircraft is sorta Rembrandt ready, no glaring issues.
It models the mid 80'ties upgraded version of JA-37 (not to be confused with JA-37D)

Help?
-----
Looking for person to model 3D cockpit and/or instruments. Contact Necolatis on the forums to get in contact, got plenty of cockpit pictures.

Liberties taken:
----------------
In the orig plane the HUD decimal delimiter is ','. I choose to use the english '.' instead.
