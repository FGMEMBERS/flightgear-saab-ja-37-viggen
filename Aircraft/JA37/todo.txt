TODO for Flightgear JA-37
=========================


Features and improvements:
--------------------------
GUI: Option to turn off verbose popups.
GUI: Improve Checklists.
GUI: Option to switch off hitting stuff above ground. (switched off now, might confuse users)
Aero: Make cannon pod detachable and have pointweight.
Aero: Air-brakes, even though they got welded shut in mid 80ties.
Aero: Disable failure system from freezing surfaces (remove failure mode bug prevents)
Model: Adjust instrument materials, and make the gauges look more similar.
Model: Proper pilot seat.
Model: Throttle.
Model: Make minimal polygon model for multiplayer LOD.
Model: Gauges that share mount design should also share geometry and textures.
Model: Make liveries that is not 59, able to not have to use base texture.
Model: Make HUD model not be square anymore. Also model support beams on each side.
Sim: Improve autopilot further. (alt-hold should use pitch not v-speed)
Sim: Make autopilot depend fully on instrument properties not sim properties.
Sim: Implement ejection seat. (with parachute?)
Sim: Make braking parachute.
Sim: Reset controls after A/P let go of them.
Sim: Stop using integers in xml where floating point is expected.
Sim: Check that all instruments and instr. lights rely on battery/generator power. Plus on instrument properties, not sim properties.
Sim: Make verbose property to be used in all nasal scripts. (possible include in options)
Sim: Air to ground missiles.
Sim: Longer range air2air missiles.
Sim: Unguided missiles with terrain collision detection. (submodels with ext. force)
Sim: Make users of FG HUD able to use combat features.
Sim: Make replay show the guided missiles flying.
Sim: Improve terrain warning system.
Sim: Hydralic pump depend on electric instead of rpm
Sim: Replace generic getValue and setValue in nasal with specific types.
Sim: Make droptank do collision detection. (use retractable)
Sim: Make drop-tank fall down. (use slaved submodel)
Effect: Rembrandt landing lightcone.
Effect: Check contrail effect is properly installed.
Effect: Make pilot faint/die due to G-forces.
Effect: Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes.
Effect: Smoke after structural break.
Effect: Adjust normalmap to be more subtle.
Effect: Show aircraft explosion in MP also.
Animation: Show wheels spinning in MP also.
Sound: More annunciater warnings and other sounds.
Sound: Make sounds when taking damage in bombable.
HUD: Make individual parts in HUD fail if the corresponding instrument fails. (like heading indicator etc.)
HUD: Make boxes for desired pitch.
HUD: Alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight. (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: Use instrument properties instead of simulation properties.
HUD: Make too low reference speed change reticle vertical tail down.
HUD: All track semi circles and semi box should have a line in them. (might degrade performance)
HUD: Adjust pilots eyes so that HUD is viewed as in the real (angle and distance). Also key to zoom in on HUD.
HUD: Sidewind indicator should really be 10 degs below plane axis line.


Bugs:
--------------
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping. [not reproduced]
Report: {JabberWocky} After A/P the plane consumes too much fuel. [not reproduceable]
Aero: The plane can spin into NaN. Check that. (maybe cap on some dampers, use FG-Plot to check which ones) [might be fixed]
Aero: {JazzTp} Landing in 40KT crosswind usually fails, 25KT crosswind can fail also if upwind rear gear touchdown first.
HUD: When the altitude difference to a target is much larger than the horizontal distance, the target positions are off.
Sim: {JazzTp} On Linux, after firing first missile, the key bindings for weapons go to other things, like exit FG. [Cannot reproduce on Win]
Sim: Missiles do not show when using FG 3.0, in FG 3.1+ they work fine. [reproduced]
Sim: Missiles will not lock on to ferries that is missing the radar properties.
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: {JazzTp} A repair did repair aircraft except for HUD, it was frozen. [not reproduced yet]
Sim: {JazzTp} Radar screen did not see MP aircraft pass by. [not reproduced yet]
HUD: {JazzTp} When FG HUD is in 2nd or 3rd mode, it does not go away when switching to custom. [reproduced]
HUD: I have experienced that tactical mode was on by default. [not reliable reproduced]
GUI: The performance monitor can duplicate itself when selecting airport. [reproduced]
Model: sim load-lag when coming near other ja37. [reproduced]
Model: Sim lag at final retraction of gear. [reproduced]
Sim: When running at reduced sim time, relocating or pausing, autostart might fail. [reproduced]
Sim: Missile that misses dont seem to delete by altitude.
Sim: When Bombable 4.5 is installed redout and blackout might not work properly. [related to certain Bombable settings I think]
Animation: Selection view does not follow carriers. (they lack radar properties)
Sim: The auto-pilot can be bank unstable when auto-coordination is turned on.
Sim: Auto-starting the plane when engine is not fully spooled down, may fail. [confirmed]
Model: CTRL-X in HUD view will not zoom to correct level.
Effect: Landing light spot can be seen in replay in external view, if it was shown when replay was started.


Issues with FG: (or my limited understanding of it)
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also.


Compatible version with FG 2.6 (on hold, as it crashes when loading ja37)
------------------------------
Smaller textures
Less polygons
Less particle effects
No radar (done)
No custom HUD (done)
Default FG HUD (done)


Livery work
-----------
Model: Improve the 31-17 grey livery.
Model: Improve the 32-17 Bl√• Petter livery. (Blue Peter)
Model: Improve the 59-16 grey livery.
Model: Improve the 61-18 strike camo livery.
Model: Improve the 57-21 red 'ghost' livery.
Model: Improve the 46-04 unknown export livery.
Model: Improve the 02-21 swedish sun livery.
Model: Make the 11-16 black/grey camo livery.
Model: Make the 12-04 black and gold livery.
Model: Make the 48-21 finnish export livery. (Akktu Stakki - Lonely Wolf)


Require modeling/texture skills (above my level):
-------------------------------------------------
Model: Model proper panels and cockpit layout.
Model: Put in more working instruments and controls. (semi doable if can find similar instrument in other plane, but too many to look through)
Animation: Animate scissor gear compression. The gears are currently modelled wrong for this.
Animation: Proper animation of gear doors.
Model: Model the reverser for reverse thrust.
Model: Make gunpod, between the fuselage and droptank.


Depends on better 3D cockpit:
-----------------------------
Sim: Make proper power flow to all and seperate external light controls. (use potemkin)
Sim: Make proper fuel pump system. (Fuel tanks 3V and 3H is used for flying upside down. All fuel to engine has to go through tank 1)
Model: Put in alot more not-working instruments and controls for immersion.


Require more data: (or aerodynamic know-how)
------------------
Aero: Detailed axial coefficients.
Aero: Mass distribution.
Aero: Detailed high speed aerodynamics.
Aero: Accurate weight of empty drop tank.
Aero: Weight of 30mm cannon pod.
