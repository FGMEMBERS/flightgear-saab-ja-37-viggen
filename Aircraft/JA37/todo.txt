High Priority:
--------------
Aero: Got some blueprints of the aircraft now, refine DATCOM to geometry of those.
Aero: Let DATCOM check for higher alpha values
Aero: high speed aerodynamics
Aero: DATCOM: Add engine intake area, and correct exhaust area
System: Put in alot more instruments
Animation: Make canopy work
HUD: add proper sidewind max
Effect: Complete vapor cone
Effect: Fix wierd shadow in front of vtail
Effect: Afterburner flame is sometimes seen at nose
Aero: Aerodynamic trims
Aero: droptank
Aero: drag due to mach, gear, flaps, elevons and groundeffect

Normal Priority:
----------------
System: All fuel to engine has to go through tank 1
System: Fuel tanks 3V and 3H is used for flying upside down
Effect: Make pilot faint/die due to G-forces
Aero: Clean up the flight controls
Sound: Better annunciater warnings and other sounds
Effect: Adapt for Rembrandt (future)
Effect: Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes
Effect: Make gears break if too high speed with gears down
Effect: Adjust the engine fire and afterburner flame more precise.
HUD: Make TILS landing system in the HUD
HUD: Make desired heading indicator in the HUD.
HUD: Make desired height columns and boxes
HUD: Different kind of pitch lines, depending on mode
HUD: make more methods out of similar code, introduce more comments and name variables better
HUD: alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: make symbol for warning: pull up!
System: Make armament/droptank selectable
Effect: Make gun fire bullets from correct position (no idea where it is..)
Effect: Glass reflection
Effect: Sun glare
Effect: Lights should have glare effect
Animation: Animate wheels
Animation: Animate gear compression
Animation: Proper animation of gear doors
During normal flight, flaps shall be kept at -4 Â° above the neutral position
Stall warnings at lower alpha at higher mach
Make engine use fuel from tank 6-7 also.
