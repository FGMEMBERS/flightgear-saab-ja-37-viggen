TODO for Flightgear JA-37
=========================

Do now
------
Crash code should use better properties not spread out all over.
Switch to combined shader for aircrafts. (als & rembrandt)
Check engine sound at reverse thrust.
On Maud PC, the plane easier spins into NaN. Check that.


Next version?:
--------------
GUI: Make little option GUI. (to test PUI and widgets)
GUI: Option to turn off verbose popups.
GUI: More and better popup feedback (gear/flaps/stalling/yawstabilizer)
GUI: Make crashing, creaking and breaking optional through menu.
GUI: Show droptank status.
GUI: Make something procedual, just to test it out.
GUI: Option to turn of certain effects.
GUI: Stats. topspeed, topalpha, topbeta, topclimb, top altitude
GUI: Set Radar dist


High Priority:
--------------
Check UV mapping for engine fire and aug flame, to make the textures smaller.
Aero: Find cause of buffeting. (autopilot also does it)
GUI: Find way to measure take-off length, climb-rate, axial force and stopwatch
Aero: Make pointmass and drag for droptank, and consider putting it in payload dialog.
GUI: Make HUD switchable to imperial units.
Sim: Fix autopilot.
Effect: Adjust normalmap to be more subtle.
Animation: Second altimeter.
Animation: Some switches.
Sound: Prevent sounds from playing at startup. (should work now, needs more testing)


Normal Priority:
----------------
Aero: Make canopy increase drag.
Sim: Make canopy able to break off.
GUI: Checklist
Sim: Limit cannon rounds to 150. (146?)
Effect: Make vortex vapor flat. (flatten texture and stop spinning it)
Effect: Rembrandt landing lightcone. (the model misses the lamp on front gear though)
Sim: Overhaul crash code. (hitting trees on water, sliding, loss of inertia when crashing, short random failure time at structural break instead of instant failure, hitting buildings)
Animation: Make wings break off when they break due to structural damage.
Aero: When wings break, remove most of normal force.
Effect: Check contrail effect is properly installed.
Animation: Adjust instrument materials.
Sim: Instruments should turn on when battery gets turned on, instead of generator, but still be able to fail when electrical system fails.


Lower priority:
----------------
HUD: Make combat mode for HUD.
Sound: More annunciater warnings and other sounds
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping.
Effect: Make pilot faint/die due to G-forces
Effect: Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes
Effect: Make gears break if too high speed with gears down
Effect: Sun glare
Effect: Smoke after structural break.
HUD: Make TILS landing system in the HUD
HUD: Make desired heading indicator in the HUD.
HUD: Make desired height columns and boxes
HUD: Different kind of pitch lines, depending on mode
HUD: make more methods out of similar code, introduce more comments and name variables better
HUD: alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: make symbol for warning: pull up! (plus annunciater)
Animation: Animate wheels
Animation: Pilot from F16CJ?
Sim: Add Bombable support, if aircraft can still work without having Bombable installed.
Sim: Implement ejection seat. (with parachute?)
Sim: Make braking parachute.


Issues with FG: (or my limited understanding of it)
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt makes the afterburner flame not transparent. (test using animator, some of the other planes achieved it)
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also, which has nothing to do with emissiveness.
Effect: The normalmap/specularmap effect makes a strange shadow down the middle.
Sim: Get flightrecorder to record position with higher frequency.
Sound: Occansional wierd buzz in model view sound when using throttle


Require modeling/texture skills (above my level):
-------------------------------------------------
Animation: Model proper panels and cockpit layout.
Animation: Put in more working instruments and controls (semi doable if can find similar instrument in other plane, but too many to look through)
Animation: Put in alot more not-working instruments and controls for immersion
Animation: Animate gear compression. The gears are currently modelled wrong for this.
Animation: Proper animation of gear doors
Animation: Model the reverser for reverse thrust.


Depends on better 3D cockpit:
-----------------------------
Sim: Make control surfaces depend on hydralic system.
Sim: Make proper power flow to external lights and HUD. (use potemkin)
Sim: Make proper fuel pump system. (Fuel tanks 3V and 3H is used for flying upside down. All fuel to engine has to go through tank 1)


Require more data: (or aerodynamic know-how)
------------------
HUD: add proper sidewind max
Effect: Make gun fire bullets from correct position (should be a pod under belly)
Sim: Make aileron and elevator deflection depend on altitude.
