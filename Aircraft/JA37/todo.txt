TODO for Flightgear JA-37
=========================


Bugs:
--------------
Aero: Find cause of buffeting. (autopilot also does it, seems like fast elevator changes is cause)
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping.
Report: After A/P the plane consumes too much fuel. [not reproduceable]
Sound: Occasional wierd buzz in external sounds.
Aero: The plane can spin into NaN. Check that. (maybe cap on some dampers, use FG-Plot to check which ones) [might be fixed]
HUD: When the altitude difference to a target is much larger than the horizontal distance, the targets are not drawn correct.


Features and improvements:
--------------------------
GUI: Option to turn off verbose popups.
GUI: More and better popup feedback. (gear/flaps/stalling/yawstabilizer)
GUI: Make something procedual, just to test it out.
GUI: Test new FGPlot.
GUI: Checklist.
GUI: Option to switch off hitting stuff above ground.
Aero: Make canopy increase drag.
Aero: When wings break, remove most of normal force.
Animation: Some switches.
Animation: Make wings break off when they break due to structural damage.
Animation: Adjust instrument materials, and make the gauges look more similar.
Animation: Animate wheels. (tough when gears get compressed..)
Animation: Pilot from F16CJ?
Animation: Make minimal polygon model for multiplayer LOD.
Animation: Min and max on several gauges.
Animation: Move center plaque forward to touch the panel.
Sim: Improve autopilot further, it wobbles.
Sim: Make canopy able to break off.
Sim: Limit cannon rounds to 150. (146?) And make menu item to reload it.
Sim: Overhaul crash code. (sliding, loss of inertia when crashing, short random failure time at structural break instead of instant failure)
Sim: Instruments should turn on when battery gets turned on, instead of generator, but still be able to fail when electrical system fails.
Sim: Add Bombable support, if aircraft can still work without having Bombable installed.
Sim: Implement ejection seat. (with parachute?)
Sim: Make braking parachute.
Sim: Reset controls after A/P let go of them.
Sim: Stop using integers in xml where floating point is expected.
Sim: Check that all instruments and instr. lights rely on battery/generator power. Plus on instrument properties, not sim properties.
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: Make verbose property to be used in all nasal scripts. (possible include in options)
Sim: Key to match speed of diamond.
Sim: Guided missile from f-14b.
Effect: Make vortex vapor flat. (flatten texture and stop spinning it) [wont fix, the particle is always attached to world not plane]
Effect: Rembrandt landing lightcone. (the model has turned the lamp on front gear backwards)
Effect: Check contrail effect is properly installed.
Effect: Make pilot faint/die due to G-forces.
Effect: Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes.
Effect: Make gears break if too high speed with gears down.
Effect: Sun glare.
Effect: Smoke after structural break.
Effect: Adjust normalmap to be more subtle.
Sound: More annunciater warnings and other sounds
Sound: Marker warning tone should be removed per default. (tied to radio ILS)
HUD: Make TILS landing system in the HUD
HUD: Make desired heading indicator in the HUD.
HUD: Make individual parts in HUD fail if the corresponding instrument fails. (like heading indicator etc.)
HUD: Make desired height columns and boxes.
HUD: Different kind of pitch lines, depending on mode.
HUD: make more methods out of similar code, introduce more comments and name variables better.
HUD: alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight. (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: make symbol for warning: pull up! (plus annunciater)
HUD: Use instrument properties instead of simulation properties.


Issues with FG: (or my limited understanding of it)
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt makes the afterburner flame not transparent. (test using animator, some of the other planes achieved it)
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also.
Sim: Get flightrecorder to record position with higher frequency.


Compatible version with FG 2.6 (on hold, as it crashes when loading ja37)
------------------------------
Smaller textures
Less polygons
Less particle effects
No radar (done)
No custom HUD (done)
Default FG HUD


Require modeling/texture skills (above my level):
-------------------------------------------------
Animation: Model proper panels and cockpit layout.
Animation: Put in more working instruments and controls. (semi doable if can find similar instrument in other plane, but too many to look through)
Animation: Animate scissor gear compression. The gears are currently modelled wrong for this.
Animation: Proper animation of gear doors.
Animation: Model the reverser for reverse thrust.
Effect: Make gun fire bullets from correct position. (should be a pod under belly)


Depends on better 3D cockpit:
-----------------------------
Sim: Make control surfaces depend on hydralic system.
Sim: Make proper power flow to external lights and HUD. (use potemkin)
Sim: Make proper fuel pump system. (Fuel tanks 3V and 3H is used for flying upside down. All fuel to engine has to go through tank 1)
Animation: Put in alot more not-working instruments and controls for immersion.


Require more data: (or aerodynamic know-how)
------------------
HUD: Proper sidewind max. (using J-35 max currently)
Aero: Detailed axial coefficient.
Aero: Mass distribution.
Aero: Detailed high speed aerodynamics.
