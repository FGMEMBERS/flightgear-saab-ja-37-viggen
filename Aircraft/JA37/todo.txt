TODO for Flightgear JA-37
=========================

Must have for FG 3.2
------
Sim: Crash code should use better properties not spread out all over.
Aero: On powerful PC, the plane easier spins into NaN. Check that. (maybe make cap on some moments, use FGGraph to check which ones)
Test new failure system.
Test new JSBSim ground contact features.
Animation: Make minimal polygon model for multiplayer LOD.
Sim: Fix autopilot.


Option GUI:
--------------
GUI: Make little option GUI. (to test PUI and widgets)
GUI: Option to turn off verbose popups.
GUI: More and better popup feedback (gear/flaps/stalling/yawstabilizer)
GUI: Make crashing, creaking and breaking optional through menu.
GUI: Show droptank status.
GUI: Make something procedual, just to test it out.
GUI: Option to turn of certain effects.
GUI: Stats. topspeed, topalpha, topbeta, topclimb, top altitude
GUI: Set Radar dist


Compatible version with FG 2.6
------------------------------
Smaller textures
Less polygons
Less particle effects
No radar
Default FG HUD
More gauges


Bugs:
--------------
Aero: Find cause of buffeting. (autopilot also does it, seems like fast elevator changes is cause)
Effect: Adjust normalmap to be more subtle.
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping.


Features:
----------------
GUI: Find way to measure take-off length, climb-rate, axial force and stopwatch.
Aero: Make pointmass and drag for droptank, and consider putting it in payload dialog.
GUI: Make HUD switchable to imperial units.
Animation: Second altimeter.
Animation: Some switches.
Aero: Make canopy increase drag.
Sim: Make canopy able to break off.
GUI: Checklist
Sim: Limit cannon rounds to 150. (146?)
Effect: Make vortex vapor flat. (flatten texture and stop spinning it) [wont fix, the particale is attached to world not plane]
Effect: Rembrandt landing lightcone. (the model misses the lamp on front gear though)
Sim: Overhaul crash code. (hitting trees on water, sliding, loss of inertia when crashing, short random failure time at structural break instead of instant failure, hitting buildings)
Animation: Make wings break off when they break due to structural damage.
Aero: When wings break, remove most of normal force.
Effect: Check contrail effect is properly installed.
Animation: Adjust instrument materials.
Sim: Instruments should turn on when battery gets turned on, instead of generator, but still be able to fail when electrical system fails.
Sound: More annunciater warnings and other sounds
Effect: Make pilot faint/die due to G-forces
Effect: Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes
Effect: Make gears break if too high speed with gears down
Effect: Sun glare
Effect: Smoke after structural break.
HUD: Make combat mode for HUD.
HUD: Make TILS landing system in the HUD
HUD: Make desired heading indicator in the HUD.
HUD: Make desired height columns and boxes
HUD: Different kind of pitch lines, depending on mode
HUD: make more methods out of similar code, introduce more comments and name variables better
HUD: alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: make symbol for warning: pull up! (plus annunciater)
Sim: Add Bombable support, if aircraft can still work without having Bombable installed.
Sim: Implement ejection seat. (with parachute?)
Sim: Make braking parachute.
Animation: Animate wheels
Animation: Pilot from F16CJ?


Issues with FG: (or my limited understanding of it)
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt makes the afterburner flame not transparent. (test using animator, some of the other planes achieved it)
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also, which has nothing to do with emissiveness.
Effect: The normalmap/specularmap/combined shader effect makes a strange shadow down the middle.
Sim: Get flightrecorder to record position with higher frequency.
Sound: Occansional wierd buzz in model view sound when using throttle
Sim: A property that gives the magnetic heading without acting as a floating compass.


Require modeling/texture skills (above my level):
-------------------------------------------------
Animation: Model proper panels and cockpit layout.
Animation: Put in more working instruments and controls (semi doable if can find similar instrument in other plane, but too many to look through)
Animation: Put in alot more not-working instruments and controls for immersion
Animation: Animate gear compression. The gears are currently modelled wrong for this.
Animation: Proper animation of gear doors
Animation: Model the reverser for reverse thrust.
Effect: Make gun fire bullets from correct position (should be a pod under belly)


Depends on better 3D cockpit:
-----------------------------
Sim: Make control surfaces depend on hydralic system.
Sim: Make proper power flow to external lights and HUD. (use potemkin)
Sim: Make proper fuel pump system. (Fuel tanks 3V and 3H is used for flying upside down. All fuel to engine has to go through tank 1)


Require more data: (or aerodynamic know-how)
------------------
HUD: add proper sidewind max
Sim: Make aileron and elevator deflection depend on altitude.
